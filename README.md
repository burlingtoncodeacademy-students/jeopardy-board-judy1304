# Jeopardy Board

Jeopardy! The great American quiz show has been a staple of network television since the 60s. In this project we will be creating our own Jeopardy board which we will build the functionality for in later weeks. For now we're going to focus on site design and navigation.

This site will consist of 4 pages: a landing page, a first round page, a second round page, and a final round page.

## Wireframes

At the following link, you will find a Figma containing the four wireframes necessary for this project.
